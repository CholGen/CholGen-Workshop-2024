Terra is tested using and intended to be accessed with the [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Sign in to Terra

3. Click "Sign In". A popup window will appear[^1]. 
4. Click "Sign in with Google", and authenticate using the credentials for your Google account.

## Cloning the CholGen Workshop Workspace

In Terra, a workspace is a way of grouping together tabular data, compute jobs, output data, and interactive notebooks. 
Workspaces are a good way to scope data by project, and each is associated with a billing project and a list of users or groups allowed to access the workspace data.
To get started, each particpant will malke a working clone of the workshop workspace. Cloning the workspace will allow you to run your own analysis and inspect outputs without overwriting others. 


1. Navigate to view the list of workspaces you can access: [https://publichealth.terra.bio/#workspaces](https://publichealth.bio/#workspaces).
2. Navigate to the workspaces page

4. Search for the workspace of interest using the Search by keyboard box. “CholGen” (the workspace is also linked [here](https://publichealth.terra.bio/#workspaces/gates-pgs-africacdc/CholGen_Workshop_Feb2024)).
5. The workspace is read-only. You will need to make your own copy that is associated with a billing project you have access to. You can do this by “cloning” the public workspace. Click on the circle with three dots on the upper right side of your workspace. A drop-down menu appears and you can select “Clone”.

6. Give the new (clone) workspace a descriptive Workspace name -- for the purposes of this workshop, include your initials or name in order to uniquely identify it (e.g. "CholGen 2024 Joe Smith"). Set the Billing project to "gates-pgs-training" (if it isn't already).
Leave the Bucket location and Description as their default values. **_DO NOT_** select "**Workspace will have protected data**". **_Do not_** select an **Authorization Domain**; doing so will complicate access and sharing of workspace data.

7. Click “**clone workspace**”.

8. This creates a copy of the original workspace for just you to use. Check that the workspace you are currently working in is your copy.
